                <h4>Studied at various schools in India</h4>
                <p>
                    I was born in India and lived in Gujarat and Bihar. I learned Gujarati,
                    my mother tongue, and picked up basic Hindi because it's the national language and spoken in my birth state.
                    I also learned English during my time in India.

                <h4>GCSE at Swaminarayan School</h4>
                Grades:
                    <ul>
                        <li>9 in Maths, Biology, Chemistry, Physics Geography</li>
                        <li>8 in Computer Science, Physical Education</li>
                        <li>A in Gujarati</li>
                        <li>6 in English Language, English Literature, Religious Studies</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    In 2012, I relocated to the UK, where I pursued my education at Swaminarayan School.
                    I completed both primary and secondary schooling at the same institution. During my secondary education,
                    I opted to study Gujarati as part of my GCSE curriculum. It was during this time that my interest in computer science
                    and mathematics began to flourish. I also gained a fundamental understanding of object-oriented programming using
                    Java through the Greenfoot platform, and I acquired the basics of HTML and CSS.

                <p>
                    I transferred to St Albans School for my A-Levels.
                    I initially pursued computer science as one of my subjects but eventually dropped it,
                    sticking with Biology, Chemistry, and Maths. During that period, I got into data science and machine learning,
                    which led me to start learning Python in my spare time.

                    I'm currently studying Data Science at Nottingham Trent University.
                    I've been honing my Python skills, particularly in areas like chatbots and web-apps.
                    I even began working on my own web-app, which gives users a cool way to check out
                    their Spotify data through a user-friendly interface. In between my first and second year,
                    I also dove into SQL to level up my skills.
